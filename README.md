# Empirical Finance: US Equities (2017â€“2018)

This project explores asset pricing and market behavior using daily US equity data from 2017 to 2018. It was developed as part of a graduate-level Empirical Finance course at HEC MontrÃ©al (Winter 2022).

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Key goals of this project include:

- Data cleaning, error checking, and exploratory analysis of returns and volume data
- Testing the normality of asset returns using QQ-plots and the Jarque-Bera test
- Comparing return distributions and volatility between major US firms (Tesla, Coca-Cola, Apple)
- Conducting hypothesis testing to assess differences in mean returns
- Using OLS and panel data regressions with fixed effects to examine the relationship between firm-level factors and stock market behavior
- Exploring behavioral influences on trading activity using a daylight-saving time dummy variable

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, SciPy
- pandas
- statsmodels, linearmodels
- matplotlib, seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ Methods Applied

- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Panel regression with fixed effects (firm and time)
- Hypothesis testing and test statistics
- Data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
